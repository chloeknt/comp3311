# COMP3311 21T3 Final Exam Q8
# Query execution times

(A)
When the server is first started, the execution plan needs to 
be generated and cached by SQL. The file system also needs to 
load the PostgreSQL files into memory. After the query is run, 
the files are loaded into memory already and subsequent
runs will utilise the same execution plan and thus be more efficient.


(B)
The first query is faster because it determines the maximum id
from an integer value. The second query requires the maximum of
date values, which have multiple components (year, month, day). 
The components need to be run through individually to consider
the overall maximum, as a single component being larger doesn't
necessarily mean the overall date is more recent.
