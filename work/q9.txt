# COMP3311 21T3 Final Exam Q9
# Flight booking triggers

(A)
The pre_booking_check function determines if:
	1. The flight number is valid within the database
	2. The flight is already full 
and raises an exception in either case. Otherwise, either the new or old 
data is returned depending on if the flight was 'DELETED' or 'INSERTED'

(B)
Other conditions that could be checked include:
	1. The booking was made after the flight has already departed
	2. The seat number exists in the aircraft


(C)
1. The first trigger executes the pre_booking_check function and no exception
is raised
2. A new booking is inserted into the Bookings table where flight_no = QF02
passenger = John Smith and seat_no = 25-D. 
3. The second trigger executes the post_booking_update function where the 
flight with flight_no = QF02 is updated, the number of booked seats (nbooked) 
increasing by one

(D)
1. The first trigger executes the pre_booking_check function and the exception
'Booking error' is raised because the flight with flight_no = QF02 is full
2. No booking is inserted into the Booking table

(E)
1. The first trigger executes the pre_booking_check function and no exception
is raised
2. The old booking is deleted from the Bookings table where flight_no = QF03
and seat_no = 15-F. 
3. The second trigger executes the post_booking_update function where the 
flight with flight_no = QF03 is updated, the number of booked seats (nbooked) 
decreasing by one
