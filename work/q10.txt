(A)
A -> B, C
D -> E, F

(B)
ABCDEF
choosing one to start with:
1. A -> B, C - violates BCNF, LHS is partial key
2. D -> E, F
3. A -> D

ABC |  A -> B, C - does not violate BCNF

ADEF |  D -> E, F - violates BCNF, LHS is partial key
     |  A -> D 
     
DEF | D -> E, F - does not violate BCNF

AD | A -> D - does not violate BCNF

Final result:
Students: A, B, C
Supervisors: D, E, F, A
